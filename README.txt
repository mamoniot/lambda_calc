My lamdba calculus engine, completed in C++. Compile the file lambda.cc to try it out.

The compiled exe has the command line format "<exe> [flags] <filename>"
The program has flags, use the flag "-help" to see them all.

The files ending in .lc contain demos and test programs for this engine.
They have comments too, particularly the file demo.lc.
